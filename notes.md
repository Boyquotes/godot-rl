# notes

# critical

- death effect / animation / sfx
- get hurt sfx
- end screens
- add the goblet

## bugs / improvements

- tile map shading is slowing game down
- smarter way to display settings
- enemy animations

## ideas

- opening cutscene after title. generated town and hero names, maybe different scenarios
- special abilities: see all enemies and exit
- multi-turn effects (get poisoned etc.)
