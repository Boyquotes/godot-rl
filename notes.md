# notes

# critical

- get hurt sfx
- end screens
- red bar low hp

## bugs / improvements

- sliming enemies: damage taking not working properly
- tile map shading is slowing game down
- smarter way to display settings

## ideas

- opening cutscene after title. generated town and hero names, maybe different scenarios
- special abilities: see all enemies and exit
- multi-turn effects (get poisoned etc.)
