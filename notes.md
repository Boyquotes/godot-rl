# notes

# critical

- death effect / animation / sfx
- get hurt sfx
- item drops (coin?)
- healing items
- end screens

## bugs / improvements

- smarter way to display settings
- walking less janky
- make enemy invisible again once in shadow?
- low pass persists when quitting from pause
- enemies rendering under items

## ideas

- increase max hp, not just to PLAYER_START_HP
- opening cutscene after title. generated town and hero names, maybe different scenarios
- special abilities: see all enemies and exit, walk through a wall
- shop level of the dungeon
- pickuppable coins
- 'effects' phase of any turn that plays out enemy animations, particles, etc., disabling player input
- multi-turn effects (get poisoned etc.)
- damage number on top of heads
